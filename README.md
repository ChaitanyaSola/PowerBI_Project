### 📌 Project Title:
** Analyzing Student Habits and Their Impact on Academic Performance Using Power BI **

 ### 🔍 Problem Statement:
Many academic institutions aim to understand how student lifestyle habits such as sleep, diet, screen time, part-time jobs, and physical activity influence academic performance. However, a clear, data-driven analysis of these behavioral factors is often lacking.

### 🎯 Project Goals:
Analyze how various lifestyle habits affect student exam performance.

* Explore gender-based behavioral patterns and their academic impact.

* Identify correlations between study habits and exam scores.

* Help educators and students make informed decisions based on visual insights.

### 📊 Visualizations Used:
Page 1 (Overview Dashboard):

* KPI Cards: Average Study Hours, Sleep Hours, Social Media Usage, Total Students.

* Bar Chart: Exam Score by Diet Quality & Gender.

* Histogram: Sleep Hours vs Exam Score.

* Donut Chart: Social Media Usage by Gender.

* Pie Chart: Exercise Frequency by Gender.

* Combo Chart: Study Hours & Exam Score vs Part-Time Job.

Page 2 (In-Depth Insights):

* Scatter Plot: Study Hours vs Attendance vs Exam Score by Gender.

* Pie Chart: Netflix Usage by Internet Quality.

* Funnel Chart: Parental Education Level Distribution.

* Area Chart: Exam Score Trend by Age.

* Combo Chart: Exam Score & Participation in Extracurricular Activities by Gender.

* KPI Card: Average Exam Score.

### 🔎 Key Insights & Observations:
* Study vs Score: Higher study hours generally correlate with better scores, especially when attendance is also high.

* Part-Time Jobs: Students without part-time jobs tend to study more and achieve higher scores.

* Sleep Impact: Students who sleep 6–7 hours perform better than those with lower or excessive sleep.

* Parental Education: Higher parental education (Bachelor or Master) is linked with slightly better academic performance.

* Diet & Performance: Students with good or fair diet quality tend to score higher on average.

* Gender Patterns: Males and females show balanced trends across habits, but gender diversity in data is respected through inclusion of "Other".

* Extracurricular Activities: Non-participating students surprisingly had slightly higher exam scores.

### 🧾 Conclusion:
This project demonstrates that multiple lifestyle factors influence academic performance. By leveraging Power BI, we can uncover meaningful patterns that help educators, parents, and students make better decisions. It highlights the value of data-driven approaches in the education sector.
